Use Pandas to clean and format your dataset or datasets. 
Create a Jupyter notebook describing the data exploration and cleanup process.
Create a Jupyter notebook illustrating the final data analysis.
Use Matplotlib to create 6 to 8 visualizations of your data 
(ideally, at least 2 visualizations per “question” that you ask your data).
Save PNG images of your visualizations to distribute to the class and instructional team—and for 
inclusion in your presentation.
Create a write-up summarizing your major findings. This should include a heading for each “question” 
that you asked your data as well as a short description of your findings and any relevant plots.
Bonus Use at least one API—if you can find one with data pertinent to your primary research questions.
