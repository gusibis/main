    "From 2010 to 2019, the US unemployment rate went through a period of significant change. The US was recovering from the 2008 financial crisis, which had led to high levels of unemployment, and the policies implemented in response to the crisis impacted the unemployment rate over the years that followed. In 2010, the unemployment rate was between 9%-10%, which was a high level that reflected the impact the financial crisis on the job market. Over the years, the unemployment rate gradually decreased as the economy recovered. By 2019, the unemployment rate dropped below 4%. AVERAGE HOURLY EARNINGS 2010-2019 From 2010 to 2019, the US average hourly earnings also experienced significant changes. In 2010, the average hourly earnings in the US were at about $20, and by 2019, they had increased to $28.29. This is about a 40% increase. This increase represents a significant improvement in the earning potential of US workers over this period. The increase in average hourly earnings over this period reflects a trend towards higher wages in the US economy, which could have positive impacts on economic growth. AVERAGE HOURLY EARNINGS 2010-2021 There are several reasons why there was a spike in average hourly earnings during the pandemic. One of the main reasons is that the pandemic led to widespread job losses, with many low-wage jobs being eliminated and high-paid workers remaining employed. This could have created what’s called a composition effect. The median wage spiked due to low-wage jobs being eliminated and high-paid jobs remaining intact. Additionally, many workers who were able to continue working during the pandemic were in essential industries such as healthcare, grocery stores, and delivery services, and these industries started paying higher wages to attract workers during a time of increased demand. This spike was momentary because it leveled out in the 3rd quarter.

In 2010, the average interest rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage was around 5%, while by 2019, the average rate had dropped to 3.1%. Additionally, low inflation and low unemployment rates also helped to keep mortgage rates low by reducing upward pressure on interest rates. https://www.moneygeek.com/mortgage/analysis/historical-mortgage-interest-rates/#:~:text=2010s,Great%20Financial%20Crisis%20of%202008.&text=The%20decrease%20in%20mortgage%20rates,the%20Great%20Recession%20in%202008.

The linear regression plot showed the relationship was strong and negative, even with the disruption of 2020 it was evident, the P value was very small and the R value including 2020 was 0.55504 Excluding 2020, it was -0.9565, a strong negative relationship\n",

    "Does the price index of a basket of goods and services paid by urban consumers affect the hourly earnings of all employees? The p-value was too small like the other 2 previous evaluations, so the R value is the one to be used, with 0.9808, very close only about 2 percent variation in the sample obtained until 2019 We can say there is strong evidence of a positive relationship.\n",

    "Does the price index of a basket of goods and services paid by urban consumers affect the 30 year fixed mortgage interest rate? The relationship was not as strong, although the P value was small and the R value (Standard deviation) was -.2478, close to zero the plot showed too much variation. Values were too scattered so we considered these 2 datasets had the list relationship\n",
