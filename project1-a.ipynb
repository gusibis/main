    "Data collection and analysis\n",
    "- 30 Year Fixed Rate Mortgage Average from https://api.stlouisfed.org/fred/series/observations?\n",
    "- Average Hourly Earnings of All Employees from https://api.stlouisfed.org/fred/series/observations?\n",
    "- Unemployment rate. Data obtained from https://fred.stlouisfed.org\n",
    "- Single Family Home value average (ZSFH) from Zillow\n",
    "- Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers. Data source https://fred.stlouisfed.org\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Data set used independently in our analysis. Could not perform a data regression with it due to the set returned in quarters instead of monthly.  \n",
    "- Gross domestic product from https://fred.stlouisfed.org \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Three of the datasets were obtained via API\n",
    "The other 3 were obtained using the library \n",
    "Nasdaq-Data-Link\n",
    "That simplified the collection by eliminating the need of adding, headers or other parameters. The API key was still required. \n",
    "\n",
    "API keys obtained from: \n",

    "Cleaning and preparing the data.\n",
    "We had to rename the 'Date' columns to match proper capitalization. \n",
    "We had to remove the 'Unamend' column after saving and opening the CSV file, Pandas was creating this new index column.\n",
    "Also to make sure the data was correct from opening the CSV file we had to reset the index. \n",
    "We also had to invert the x-axis for some of the plots so they were correct\n",
    "For better presentation we removed the day from the date and left the Year and the Month. \n",
    "Unsuccessfully to convert some of the datasets to quarterly to create a linear regression plot. \n",
    "For better presentation used the plt.MaxNLocator() function to set a maximum number of tickers for the x axis that displays the years. \n",
    "Created a function generate the linear regression plots that takes the 2 data frames, the Y and X axis labels as arguments.  \n",
    "Had to revert some data so the plot went from left to right, older to newer date. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Questions:\n",
    "Does the price index of a basket of goods and services paid by urban consumers affect the unemployment rate, how? \n",
    "The linear regression plot showed the relationship was strong and negative, even with the disruption of 2020 it was evident, the P value was very small and the R value including 2020 was 0.55504\n",
    "Excluding 2020, it was -0.9565, a strong negative relationship\n",
    "\n",
    "Does the price index of a basket of goods and services paid by urban consumers affect the single family home value?\n",
    "The P value was too small, the R value of 0.9209, plus the consistency in the plot shows there is a strong positive relationship. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Does the price index of a basket of goods and services paid by urban consumers affect the hourly earnings of all employees? \n",
    "The p-value was too small like the other 2 previous evaluations, so the R value is the one to be used, with 0.9808, very close only about 2 percent variation in the sample obtained until 2019 \n",
    "We can say there is strong evidence of a positive relationship. \n",
    "\n",
    "Does the price index of a basket of goods and services paid by urban consumers affect the 30 year fixed mortgage interest rate? \n",
    "The relationship was not as strong, although the P value was small and the R value (Standard deviation) was -.2478, close to zero the plot showed too much variation. \n",
    "Values were too scattered so we considered these 2 datasets had the list relationship \n",
    "\n",
    "The disruption in the economy that occurred in 2020 was stabilized in about 1.5 year, It increased the unemployment by over 10%, GDP dropped over 3 billion dollars, the hourly wages increased by about 2 dollars.\n",
    "Average Single family home prices increased by about 20 thousand dollars in average and kept going up well after 2020, so we are not sure if it really made an impact \n",
    "The 30 year fixed interest rate could not be related to the 2020 disruption. \n"
